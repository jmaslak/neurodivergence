# Workplace Accommodations / Adjustments

A common thing people tell me after getting a diagnosis for autism, ADHD,
dyslexia, or other type of neurodivergent is, "I told HR I'm ..., and
they asked me what I need. I have no idea what I need!"  This is here to
help with that.

This is a long list of possible accommodations.  Most probably will not
help you, but it may be a good place to look for ideas. In many cases,
none will help you. That's fine! Other times, the accommodations may be
something your employer is unwilling to grant (for instance, remote
work). Only you know your needs, and your job context will be unique.
What one company embraces may be what another excludes.

This is also a very long list! Consider reading just one section at a
time and thinking on it. If you have a coach/therapist that can help,
consider talking to them. A neurodivergent friend might also be able to
help.

Most of these are applicable primarily to a professional workplace where
you have some control over how you do your job.  I'm interested in tips
for other types of jobs!  Most also put the effort on the employee,
which is unfair and unjust, but often workplaces won't change to be more
friendly to us on their own, and we'll need to do the majority of the
effort. I want to acknowledge this is unjust, even as I provide these
techniques.

Regardless, you deserve an environment that fits your mind. I hope you
are able to get that.

Finally, I know that these things won't solve every problem. None of
them may be helpful to you.  Suggestions are welcome, either via
[email](mailto:jmaslak@antelope.net) or via pull request.  If emailing,
please indicate if you would like credit, and, if so, how you would
like to be credited.

## A Caution to HR / Diversity Groups

You can't pick 10 of these (or even all of them) and say "we're
neurodivergence-friendly!" What one person needs is different from what
another needs, and an environment perfect for one neurodivergent person
may be hell for another. This is merely a collection of ideas. That said,
some things clearly do help a lot of neurodivergent and other people
(I.E. things like private offices, options for remote work, flexibility
in scheduling, etc.). In fact the things that help the largest number of
people are the very things a lot of companies don't actually want to do.
But if you want to claim neurodivergence-friendliness, those are areas
to focus on.

## Figuring out Tasks

 - Get tasks in writing
 - Frequent 1-1 with manager
 - Chatbots can sometimes break down tasks into smaller pieces
 - Use charts for tasks you have to do frequently

## Remembering/Prioritizing Tasks

 - Physical planner
 - Task-tracking software (either professional software or simple task
   applications like Android or Apple task apps)
 - Developing a system with a coach
 - Review prioritization in 1-1 with manager
 - Nagging reminders like [Due](https://www.dueapp.com/) does
 - Leaving "signposts" around that remind you that you need to do a task
   (for instance, a piece of paper on the floor in front you have to walk
   over to leave your office)
 - Notepad to jot down tasks you think of while otherwise busy
 - Consider a "daily task list" that takes just a few things off your
   master task list so you aren't overwhelmed. Create a new one each
   day.

## Distraction

 - Visual indications that you are busy ("focus flags")
 - Using "do not disturb mode" in messaging apps
 - Gray-scale mode on phone
 - Disable notifications and badges except *truly* important ones
 - Set up work/home profiles to control what notifications show up when
 - Remove social media apps (use the web app)
 - Separate devices for personal/work (only use social media on personal
   device, leave personal device away from your workspace)
 - If you are a "hybrid" worker, consider where you are most productive,
   and plan difficult tasks where you are most productive (home vs.
   office)
 - Turn off IM/Slack notification sounds
 - Turn off IM/Slack notifications on your phone
 - Speed up video if you are watching stuff that is boring, to encourage
   your focus

## Visual and Motion Distraction / Overload

 - Desk not in visual sight of heavy-movement areas
 - Turn off animations (and animated emojis) in your messaging/Slack
   client
 - Use the "reduce motion" settings on your phone and computer
 - The "Hide Gemini" extension can turn off some distracting Google Gemini
   elements in your browser (If you don't use these features)
 - If your OS / phone supports it (Apple, Android), you can utilize color
   filters to change to reduce loud colors
 - If your OS / phone supports it (Apple, Android), you can use a color
   tint option to make the screen color more pleasing
 - Dim room lights (or remove bulbs)
 - Ask coworkers to avoid things like looping animations in slide decks

## Auditory Distraction / Overload

 - Noise canceling headphones
 - Desk location away from loud locations
 - Private office
 - Work with laptop outdoors if that is nicer for your ears
 - Eat in quieter location than cafeteria that is less overloading
 - Let coworkers know your preferences, and ask to move conversations
   and meetings from loud spaces
 - Work from home / hybrid

## Visual Processing Difficulties

 - Increase your cursor side or change the color/outline
 - Use your OS's mouse locating technology
 - See also the visual and motion distraction / overload section above

## Attention Shifting

 - Plan meetings in "blocks" so you have more uninterrupted time
 - Schedule focus time to prevent meetings from intruding
 - Use focus flag or busy indicators to minimize interruptions

## Startle

 - Use a mirror on your monitor / cube / etc, so you can see behind you
 - Ask for desk located in a corner or other location you can see people
   approaching
 - Select a conference room seat near a corner
 - Adjust phone alert settings (particularly Amber Alerts in the USA!)
 - Adjust or ask others to adjust particularly startling sounds
 - Ask to be notified in advance of fire drills and consider working
   from another location or preparing yourself in advance

## Reading

 - Use color filters / tint on your computer/phone if certain colors are
   easier
 - Browser extensions like Stylebot can let you customize CSS of web pages
 - "Reader Mode" in browsers
 - "Reader Line" Chrome extension gives a visual ruler that highlights a
   line across a page, to make tracking the words easier
 - Most OSes have built-in text-to-speech to read texts
 - Consider printing important documents if that helps
 - Ask others to use certain colors/fonts in presentations if that helps
   you
 - Ask for exemption from policies around docs that would normally prohibit
   copy/pasting docs, and permission to copy/paste so you can paste into
   your own doc and change font/color/etc.

## Memory

 - Note taking apps
 - Personal wikis
 - Physical notepad
 - Take notes about people you work with, if you have a hard time
   remembering things about people.
 - Use "remind" feature in email and Slack if you'll forget to respond
   to something.
 - Use a physical or computer todo list so you can see your tasks

## Writing

 - Tools such as Grammarly
 - Dictation software (built into many OSes)
 - Use text-to-speech software to read your document back to you to
   catch mistakes
 - Ask to be assigned tasks that have less writing when possible

## Travel

 - An app like Tripit to gather all of your travel information about
   each trip in one spot
 - Take pictures of receipts on-the-spot so you don't lose them
 - TSA pre-check or Global Entry can make security somewhat easier at
   airports in the USA
 - Consider whether the Hidden Disability Sunflower program might be
   useful for you to have a somewhat discreet indicator of hidden
   disability
 - Use disability lines at airport (inform them that you have trouble
   standing in line, if you do)
 - Packing cubes can make it easier to travel
 - Ask people in the destination location to provide pictures of the
   venue in advance
 - Separate travel and work days (I.E. don't have a meeting on the day
   you fly)
 - Create a packing checklist you can reuse
 - Create an "out the door" checklist for most important items (laptop,
   purse/wallet, phone, sensory defense items, etc)
 - The more money you spend, the less unpleasant travel will generally
   be. If allowed, consider upgrading.

## Attention / Memory at Meetings

 - Take notes
 - Ask for materials such as slides before the meeting
 - Use automatic captions with history if you might get distracted
 - Ask to have meetings in rooms that make it easier to concentrate
 - Use a weighted lap pad if the pressure will help calm you
 - Consider using a chair that gives more input (harder rather than
   softer) if that helps, or sit on the floor / stand against a wall
   if allowed! (turns out most places don't have rules against this!)

## Difficulty Hearing / Understanding Speech

 - Auto-captions in video meetings
 - CART (captions by a human)
 - Live captions in your OS, particularly for uncaptioned videos
 - "Live Transcribe" iOS application for live meeting captions
 - Captioning telephones
 - Consider talking to an audiologist (if you can "hear okay" but just
   can't figure out speech, you may want to see someone that has a
   specialty in audio processing disorder)
 - Use hearing aids with remote microphone technology
 - Ask for captions in large meetings
 - Ask for team social events to be in quiet locations
 - Ask for meeting materials ahead of time
 - Slow down video when watching videos

## Meeting Overload

 - Review meetings with your manager periodically
 - Skip meetings you don't actually need to be at
 - Ask for an agenda so you can determine if you should attend

## Transitions

 - Schedule transition time between tasks that may require it.
 - Do "stims" (like rocking, fidgets, etc) if the repetition helps calm
   you, as a transition activity
 - Keep a schedule of the day visible so you aren't surprised by
   transitions

## Recognizing Coworkers (Prosopagnosia)

 - Inform coworkers
 - Ask coworkers to introduce themselves if you don't recognize them
 - Ask coworkers in meeting rooms when on video conference to introduce
   themselves
 - Ask event organizers to utilize name tags

## Social Interactions

 - Inform coworkers that you may interact differently (and how that may
   show up)
 - Discuss situation with your manager or a trusted colleague
 - Create a "How to work with me" document to help people understand how
   you work best
 - Give yourself transition time after social interactions, proportional
   to how draining the interactions were
 - Use communication modes that work best for you when something is
   really important
 - Use augmentative and assistive communication (AAC), particularly for
   emotionally-intense conversations
 - Use instant messenger or other forms of asynchronous communication

## Cross-Neurotype Communication

 - If not opposed to LLMs, use a chatbot to rephrase something to the
   target neurotype.  I.E. "Rephrase this in a way that a
   neurotypical would understand: ..." or "Say this in a way that makes
   sense to an ADHD person: ..."
 - Inform others of your differences / preferences in communication,
   around things like directness or small talk
 - Let people know that you might not read emotions well or they might
   not be able to read your emotions well

## Varying Energy Levels

 - Be aware of your most productive daily hours and try to schedule
   difficult tasks then
 - Ask for flexible hours or modified start/end times
 - Flex hours between weeks
 - Part-time work

## Unwritten Rules

 - Ask for clarification on what is acceptable ("Can I expense X?")
 - Ask other neurodivergent colleagues how they interpret a rule ("What
   do they really mean by 'unlimited vacation'?")
 - Ask teammates what they do in certain situations
 - Ask for clarifications when vague words are used ("casual dress",
   "professional")

## Experiencing Overload / Strong Emotions

 - Remove yourself before you can't cope if possible (consequences for
   overload is usually worse than it is for leaving a situation)
 - Tell others why you might need to leave sometimes
 - Take breaks or avoid things that are particularly draining (for
   instance, optional social events)
 - Find ways to incorporate processing time into your day (walks, music,
   stimming, etc)
 - Use slower communication methods when communication highly emotional
   content (I.E. email rather than responding in-the-moment)

## Motor Skills / Coordination

 - Pencil grips
 - Mechanical pencils (like Delgard) that make it harder to break the
   lead
 - Pencils instead of pens if you are messy with pens
 - Cups/mugs with tops to minimize spills
 - Use electronic drawing software rather than dry erase boards
 - Backpack for carrying things
 - Keep a stain removal pen in your work location

## Time Awareness

 - Phone timer apps can remind you to stop at a certain point
 - Apps to remind you to look away from a screen occasionally, to help
   you track passage of time (these are usually marketed as preventing
   eye strain or improving wellness, but they work for time awareness
   too)
 - Use phone calendar app with remniders
 - Visual timers (where you can see the amount of time left before you
   want to switch), either physical or application
 - Include travel time before/after meetings ("I need 5 minutes to take
   the elevator from the 12th floor to the 8th floor")
 - Creating a more rigid schedule
 - Lights on a timer to remind you when you need to leave work or eat
   lunch
 - Add lunch and break times as appointments on your calendar

## Commute

 - Work from home
 - Flexible start time (to account for unpredictable transit)
